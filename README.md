###Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS

###Game Logic

* Only one question will be shown at a time. The time limit will apply to each question, and when the time runs out, the game will show a screen with the correct answer, and then move on to the next question without user input.
* If the user chooses the correct answer, the game will show a screen letting them know the answer was correct, and then move on to the next question without user input.
* If the user chooses the incorrect answer, the game will show a screen with the correct answer, and then move on to the next question without user input.
* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
